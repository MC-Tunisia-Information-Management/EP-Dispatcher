# EP-Dispatcher
The "EPâ€™s Dispatcher" script automates the allocation of EPs (Exchange Participants) to managers based on availability and workload. It retrieves EP data from a CRM sheet and checks for unassigned EPs. Using a list of managers and their email addresses from the "Contact List oGV" sheet, the script assigns EPs to managers who have capacity (less than 2 assigned EPs). If all managers are at capacity, it assigns EPs to the manager with the least workload. The script updates the CRM sheet with the assigned manager's name and notifies them via email, including EP details for tracking purposes. It ensures efficient distribution of EPs while maintaining workload balance among managers, enhancing management and tracking of EP assignments.
